# Inventory file used by custom Puppet ENC
#
# Environments are defined as hashes and may optionally assign classes, class parameters, and variables
#
# The 'nodes' hash is primarily used to assign environments to nodes, but can
# also assign classes, class parameters, and variables.  Nodes inherit settings
# from the assigned environment, but values specifically assigned to a node will
# take precedent.  Any node that that is not defined will default to the
# 'production' environment.

# production environment
production:                                         # production environment definition
  classes:                                          # assigned classes hash
    puppet:                                         # the 'puppet' class has no parameters assigned
    ntp:                                            # the 'ntp' class has a class parameter
      ntpserver: 0.pool.ntp.org                     # class parameter `ntpserver` for class `ntp`
  parameters:                                       # top-scope variables hash
    mail_server: mail.example.com                   # this value will take precedent over anything from a manifest
